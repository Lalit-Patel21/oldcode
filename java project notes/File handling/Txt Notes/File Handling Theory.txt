		                FILE HANDLING


In java, file handling means interacting with the "File System" of our computer and performing two kinds of operations:

1. Operations which allows us to access "File Attributes"

2.Operation which allows us to perform read/write operations in a file.

For 1st category of operations, java provides us a class called "File"

For 2nd category of operations, java provides us 4 classes called "OutputStream", "InputStream", "Writer" and "Reader".

First two deal with binary mode of file handling, the last two deal with text mode.

All these classes are available in the package java.io.

		FILE HANDLING


In java , file handling means interacting with the "File System" of our computer and performing two kinds of operations:

1. Operations which allow us to access "File Attributes"

2.Operations which allow us to perform read/write operations in a file.

For Ist category of operations ,java provides us a class called "File"

For IInd category of operations , java provides us 4 classes called "OutputStream" , "InputStream" , "Writer" and "Reader".

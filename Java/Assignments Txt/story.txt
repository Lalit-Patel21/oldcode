एक दिन अकबर के दरबार में किसी ने सवाल पूछा, "शहर में कितने कौवे हैं?", किसी के पास जवाब नहीं था।
बीरबल ने तुरंत उत्तर दिया "चार हजार तीन सौ बारह"। उनसे पूछा गया कि उन्हें ये कैसे पता चला?
बीरबल ने कहा, "अपने आदमी को कौवों की गिनती के लिए बाहर भेजो। यदि यह संख्या इस संख्या से कम है, तो कुछ कौवे अन्यत्र अपने परिवारों से मिलने आ रहे हैं और यदि यह संख्या इससे अधिक है, तो बाहर से कुछ कौवे अपने परिवारों से मिलने यहाँ आ रहे हैं।" उत्तर से खुश होकर उन्होंने बीरबल को उसकी बुद्धि के लिए उपहारों से नवाज़ा।
 
कहानी की नीति:
कभी-कभी आपको दायरे से बाहर सोचना सीखना होगा।

Be wise while counting

One day in Akbar’s court someone asked the question, "How many crows are there in the city?", No one had the answer.
Birbal quickly replied "Four thousand three hundred and twelve". He was asked how did he know this?
Birbal send " Send your man out to count the crows. If it is lesser than this number then some crows are visiting their families elsewhere and if it is more than this number, then some crows from outside are visiting their families here. Akbar was very happy with the answer and showered Birbal with gifts for his wit.
 
Moral of the story:
Sometimes you have to learn to think outside of the box.


story

"एक समय की बात है, सम्राट अकबर के भव्य दरबार में बीरबल नाम का एक बुद्धिमान और बुद्धिमान सलाहकार था। बीरबल अपने चतुर समाधान और त्वरित सोच के लिए दूर-दूर तक जाने जाते थे।"

"हर दिन, अकबर का दरबार गपशप और गतिविधि से भरा रहता था। विद्वान, सलाहकार और दरबारी महत्वपूर्ण मामलों पर चर्चा करने और जटिल समस्याओं को हल करने के लिए इकट्ठा होते थे। पूरे राज्य से लोग अपने प्रश्न लेकर आते थे और अकबर और उसकी बुद्धिमत्ता की तलाश करते थे। प्रतिभाशाली सलाहकार, बीरबल।"

"एक दिन, इन सभाओं में से एक के दौरान, एक जिज्ञासु आगंतुक खड़ा हुआ और उसने एक ऐसा प्रश्न पूछा जिससे सभी को अपना सिर खुजलाना पड़ा। उसने पूछा, 'शहर में कितने कौवे हैं?' प्रश्न इतना असामान्य था कि किसी को भी इसका उत्तर नहीं पता था।”

"सभी की निगाहें बीरबल की ओर थीं, यह देखने के लिए कि वह इस पेचीदा सवाल को कैसे संभालेंगे। बीरबल ने बिना एक पल भी गंवाए आत्मविश्वास से उत्तर दिया, 'चार हजार तीन सौ बारह।' उनके सटीक उत्तर से चकित होकर अदालत फुसफुसाहट से गूंज उठी।"

"दरबार में किसी ने, जो अभी भी उत्सुक था, पूछा, 'बीरबल, तुम्हें वह नंबर कैसे मिला?' बीरबल ने आंखों में चमक लाते हुए जवाब दिया, 'कौवों की गिनती करने के लिए अपने आदमियों को बाहर भेजो। यदि यह संख्या इससे कम है, तो कुछ कौवे अपने परिवार के पास कहीं और जा रहे हैं यहां परिवार हैं।' अकबर बीरबल के चतुराईपूर्ण तर्क से प्रसन्न हुए और उनकी बुद्धिमता के लिए उन्हें उपहारों से नवाज़ा।

"और इसलिए, बीरबल की त्वरित सोच और रचनात्मक उत्तर ने न केवल समस्या का समाधान किया बल्कि दरबार का मनोरंजन भी किया। 

कहानी का सार यह है कि कभी-कभी, आपको दायरे से बाहर सोचना सीखना होगा। ऐसा करने से आप कठिन से कठिन प्रश्नों का भी समाधा न पा सकते हैं।”

"Once upon a time, in the magnificent court of Emperor Akbar, there was a wise and witty advisor named Birbal.Birbal was known far and wide for his clever solutions and quick thinking."

"Every day, the court of Akbar was filled with chatter and activity. Scholars, advisors, and courtiers would gather to discuss important matters and solve complex problems. People from all over the kingdom would bring their questions, seeking the wisdom of Akbar and his brilliant advisor, Birbal."

"One day, during one of these gatherings, a curious visitor stood up and asked a question that left everyone scratching their heads. He asked, 'How many crows are there in the city?' The question was so unusual that no one knew the answer."

"All eyes turned to Birbal, waiting to see how he would handle this tricky question. Without missing a beat, Birbal replied confidently, 'Four thousand three hundred and twelve.' The court erupted in whispers, amazed at his precise answer."

"Someone in the court, still curious, asked, 'How did you come up with that number, Birbal?' With a twinkle in his eye, Birbal replied, 'Send your men out to count the crows. If it is less than this number, then some crows are visiting their families elsewhere. If it is more, then some crows from outside are visiting their families here.' Akbar was delighted by Birbal's clever reasoning and showered him with gifts for his wit."

"And so, Birbal's quick thinking and creative answer not only solved the problem but also entertained the court. 

The moral of the story is that sometimes, you have to learn to think outside the box. By doing so, you can find solutions to even the most difficult questions."

Working Career

Pichai worked in engineering and product management at Applied Materials and in management consulting at McKinsey & Company.

He joined Google in 2004. Initially he worked on Google’s search toolbar as a part of a small team. The toolbar gave users of Internet Explorer and Firefox easy access to Google search.



He also worked on other Google products like Google Gears and Google Pack. The success of Google’s toolbar gave Pichai the idea that Google should develop its own browser. He discussed his idea with his seniors and faced an objection from then-CEO Eric Schmidt, who thought that developing a browser would be a too expensive affair.

However, Pichai persevered and convinced the co-founders of Google, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, to launch Google’s own browser. Pichai played a pivotal role in the ultimate launch of the browser, Google Chrome, in 2008. Chrome proved to be a great success as it allowed the users to directly access Google’s search engine.

Pichai became an internationally known figure following the phenomenal success of the Chrome which eventually became the No. 1 browser in the world, surpassing competitors such as Internet Explorer and Firefox. The Chrome also paved the way for a series of other important products like Chrome OS, Chromebooks, and Chromecast.

In 2008, Pichai was promoted to Vice President of product development. In this position he started appearing more often at Google presentations and continued rising up the ranks in Google. By 2012, he had become the Senior Vice President of Chrome and apps.

On 19 November 2009, Pichai gave a demonstration of Chrome OS and the Chromebook was released for trial and testing in 2011, and released to the public in 2012. On 20 May 2010, he announced the open-sourcing of the new video codec VP8 by Google, and introduced the new video format, WebM.



In 2013, Andy Rubin, the creator of Android, left to work on a different project. Larry Page then made Pichai in-charge of Android as well. His influence continued to increase and he was made the Product Chief in October 2014.

Pichai had been suggested as a contender for Microsoft’s CEO in 2014, a position that was eventually given to Satya Nadella.

In 2015, Google formed a company, Alphabet Inc., to serve as a holding company and conglomerate to own the subsidiaries that were previously owned by Google, including a new “slimmed down” version of Google itself. On 10 August 2015, Sundar Pichai was named the new CEO of Google.

In February 2016, he was awarded 273,328 shares of Google’s holding company Alphabet, which led to a rise in his net worth. These shares were worth $199 million, and this took his holdings up to $650 million.



The Google CEO is not at all “nerdy” as his appearance might suggest! He is actually very grounded, helpful and friendly.

 

Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Alphabet Inc. and Google LLC, is one of the most respected and admired business leaders in the world today. Under his leadership, Google has grown into one of the most innovative and successful companies in history, with a range of products and services that have transformed the way we live and work.

Malaysia is a fascinating country in Southeast Asia, known for its cultural diversity, modern cities, and stunning natural landscapes (आश्चर्यजनक प्राकृतिक परिदृश्य). The capital, Kuala Lumpur, is a bustling metropolis (हलचल भरा महानगर) famous for the iconic(प्रतिष्ठित) Petronas T win Towers, which were once the tallest buildings in the world. Malaysia is unique in that it’s split into two main regions: Peninsular Malaysia, which is connected to mainland Asia, and East Malaysia, located on the northern part of the island of Borneo. This geographical diversity gives Malaysia a wide range of environments, from the busy urban centers and beautiful beaches to ancient rainforests teeming with wildlife(वन्य जीवन से भरपूर).

The country has a population of about 34 million people, and its society is a rich tapestry of cultures, primarily Malay, Chinese, and Indian, along with various indigenous groups(स्वदेशी समूह). This mix of cultures is reflected in the country's languages, religions, and festivals. Malay is the official language, but English is widely spoken, making it easy for visitors and residents from different backgrounds to communicate. Islam is the predominant religion, but Malaysia is also home to significant communities of Buddhists, Christians, Hindus, and those practicing traditional beliefs (पारंपरिक मान्यताओं का पालन करने वाले). This religious diversity is celebrated through various festivals like Hari Raya, Chinese New Year, Deepavali, and Christmas, making the country a vibrant and inclusive place.(इस धार्मिक विविधता को हरि राया, चीनी नव वर्ष, दीपावली और क्रिसमस जैसे विभिन्न त्योहारों के माध्यम से मनाया जाता है, जिससे देश एक जीवंत और समावेशी स्थान बन जाता है।)

Economically, Malaysia is well-developed, with a strong focus on industries such as manufacturing, palm oil production, and tourism. The country is known for producing electronics, automotive parts, and petroleum, which are key contributors to its economy. Tourism is also a major industry, with millions of visitors coming each year to experience Malaysia’s cultural heritage, beautiful islands like Langkawi and Penang, and natural wonders such as the Taman Negara rainforest and Mount Kinabalu in Borneo.


When it comes to food, Malaysia is a paradise (स्वर्ग) for food lovers, offering a mix of Malay, Chinese, Indian, and indigenous cuisines (स्वदेशी व्यंजन). Popular dishes include nasi lemak, which is coconut rice served with spicy sambal, and satay((नासी लेमक और सताय)), which is grilled meat on skewers served with peanut sauce. The country’s food reflects its multicultural society (बहु - सांस्कृतिक समाज), with different communities contributing their own flavors and cooking styles to the national cuisine.

In summary, Malaysia is a country that beautifully blends tradition and modernity (परंपरा और आधुनिकता का मिश्रण), offering a rich cultural experience, economic opportunities, and a wide range of natural attractions. Its diverse society, strong economy, and natural beauty make it a unique and appealing place to visit or live.

New iOS bug causes Apple iPhone to crash if a certain sequence of characters are typed
The issue is only restricted to typing in Spotlight Search from your home screen or on the App Library search bar

A security researcher recently found that there was a bug in iOS that could lead the iPhone to crash when certain characters were typed in a sequence. If users typed “”::” followed by any fourth character into Spotlight Search or App Library could either the phone to either freeze or reboot. 

While this wasn’t found to be a security issue, the bug can be triggered by any user manually typing the characters. 


नए iOS बग के कारण यदि वर्णों का एक निश्चित क्रम टाइप किया जाता है तो Apple iPhone क्रैश हो जाता है
समस्या केवल आपके होम स्क्रीन से या ऐप लाइब्रेरी सर्च बार पर स्पॉटलाइट सर्च टाइप करने तक ही सीमित है

एक सुरक्षा शोधकर्ता ने हाल ही में पाया कि iOS में एक बग था जिसके कारण कुछ अक्षर एक क्रम में टाइप करने पर iPhone क्रैश हो सकता था। यदि उपयोगकर्ता स्पॉटलाइट सर्च या ऐप लाइब्रेरी में ""::" के बाद कोई चौथा अक्षर टाइप करते हैं तो फोन या तो फ्रीज हो सकता है या रिबूट हो सकता है। 

हालाँकि यह कोई सुरक्षा समस्या नहीं पाई गई, लेकिन किसी भी उपयोगकर्ता द्वारा मैन्युअल रूप से अक्षर टाइप करने पर बग ट्रिगर हो सकता है।

Microsoft said they will be releasing their controversial Recall feature in October this year. The AI feature that takes screenshots of every task in Windows was criticised after being announced, over its potential privacy issues. 

Microsoft delayed the release at the last-minute, right before their CoPilot+PCs event held earlier in May.
